	Tomorrow we check how we test. Try setting it up on remix and trying with metamask and after that
	trying to get together an app.

	Should we implement a timelimit, in that case where (when to start/stop)?
	How to retrieve the winning proposal in BRF.

	How does the has look like (format, size etc.)?
